# dataset-for-ocr
so like this is a code of text detector from the website pyimage search in which he gave the code and when i implemented in my sample images 
it was detecting but not in a proper way .
so i was given the idea look since you have not trained the model from your dataset so it will not be accurate .
i tried to train the model on my dataset, 
and i did it finally which i will be putting in another repository . but to my surprise when i put my trained 
model pb file in place of frozen east text detector , it didnt work out .
so as a final i am submitting this alone .
any help that what could i have done and where did i go wrong is deeply appreciated.


ps: my teeam project was regarding extraction of critical text from medicines,
    i trained my dataset usig resnet50,mobilenetv1 ,and frcnn,
    it didn't work out 
    - -

    the critical problem in which i got stuck is the model was not detecting the right text,i mean not creating bounding box.
